# Modal pattern in react

Modal, Dialog and Toast like components always need internal states to render properly like `open`, `setOpen`
However, What we actually needs for control modal is `openModal` and `closeModal` method.
We can abstract Modal like component using context API and custom hook.
By doing this, We can make our page component much clear and easy to understand
